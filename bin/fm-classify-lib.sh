# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests and, for the always-on watcher, the provably-working predicate that makes
# no-verb signal and stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
#
# The one exception is the "provably working" predicate (crew_is_provably_working
# and its signal-path wrapper). It is NOT a pure status-file read: it reuses
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call, to decide
# whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale shows positive evidence
# it is still working. Callers run it ONLY on no-verb signal handling and first
# sighting of a stale hash, never on every wake, so the per-wake triage stays
# cheap.

# 0 if crew <id> shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working; 1 otherwise. This is

# SURFACED otherwise (the crew may be done, waiting on a decision, or wedged).
# For stale panes, this verdict is checked before trusting the status log so a
# pre-validation captain-relevant line does not override an active run.
#
# It reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh rather than duplicating its run-step logic, and
# treats the crew as provably working in exactly two cases, both read straight from

#   (a) state working from source run-step - the crew's no-mistakes run for its
#       branch is in an actively-running step (running/fixing/ci), NOT terminal,
#       parked, passed, or failed; OR
#   (b) state working from source pane     - the pane shows the harness busy
#       signature.
# Everything else - a terminal/parked/failed run, an idle pane that fell back to a
# stale "working:" status-log line (source status-log), a torn-down or unknown
# crew, or an unreadable verdict - is NOT provably working, so the wake surfaces.
# NOT a pure read: fm-crew-state.sh may make a bounded no-mistakes call, so this
