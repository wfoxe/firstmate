description: Sweep the current session for uncaptured durable knowledge, file it to disk before a context reset, and occasionally prune/compress curated memory so it stays lean. Use when the captain invokes /stow (e.g. "/stow", "stow what you've learned", "/stow prune"), before a session reset or context compaction, or periodically to keep operational memory current.

# stow

Sweep this session for durable knowledge that only exists in conversation right now, and write it to the disk locations firstmate already prints in the next session-start context digest.
The goal is a session that is safe to reset or destroy because everything durable has already been captured.

## What it does

1. **Sweep the session for uncaptured durable knowledge.**
   Read back over this conversation and look for:
   - Operational learnings: fleet-local facts and gotchas discovered while operating firstmate (a script's sharp edge, a harness quirk, a recurring false alarm and its real cause).
   - Captain preferences expressed in passing: a working-style or approval preference the captain stated conversationally rather than through `data/captain.md` directly.
   - Project-intrinsic facts discovered: build, test, release, or architecture facts about a project that belong in that project's own `AGENTS.md`.
   - Decisions made: a standing choice the captain made this session that should outlive it.
   - Undone next steps: anything left open that has not yet been filed as backlog work.

2. **Route each finding using AGENTS.md's knowledge-routing table.**
   AGENTS.md (section 6, "Knowledge routing") is the single source of truth for where each kind of knowledge belongs.
   Read that table and route each finding there instead of re-deriving the mapping here.

3. **Write within firstmate's existing write boundaries.**
   This skill does not grant any new write permission; it only prompts firstmate to use the boundaries that already exist (AGENTS.md section 1):
   - Captain preferences and fleet-local operational facts: hand-write directly, to `data/captain.md` and `data/learnings.md` respectively.
     `data/learnings.md` may not exist yet; create it on first learning, in the same dated, evidence-backed, curated style as `data/captain.md` - rewrite and prune stale or superseded entries rather than appending forever.
   - Project-intrinsic knowledge: never hand-write a project's `AGENTS.md`.
     Route it through a normal ship task so a crewmate records it via `bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh` and commits it through that project's delivery pipeline, exactly as section 6 describes.
     If the fleet is live, delegate this to a crewmate rather than doing it inline.
   - Knowledge generalizable to every firstmate user: this repo's own `AGENTS.md` (or other shared, tracked material), shipped through the normal branch -> no-mistakes -> PR -> captain-merge pipeline for this repo (section 1), never hand-committed straight to `main`.
   - Task-scoped notes: append to the relevant backlog item's notes with `tasks-axi update <id> --append "<note>"`, or hand-edit `data/backlog.md` per the active backend (section 10).
   - Undone next steps: file each as a queued backlog item (section 10), with `blocked-by` recorded if it genuinely depends on something else.

4. **Run gated memory hygiene after routing and filing.**
   This phase keeps the files that firstmate loads at every session start from accumulating months of tokens.
   It is intentionally cheap on ordinary `/stow` runs: first check the gate below, and do the full prune/compress pass only when a trigger fires.

   Scope is limited to the curated memory files in the active firstmate home:
   - `data/captain.md`
   - `data/learnings.md`
   - `data/projects.md` registry descriptions

   Explicitly out of scope:
   - Task briefs and scout reports under `data/<id>/`: these are read on demand and do not add session-load cost.
   - `data/backlog.md`: its Done section already self-prunes through the active backlog backend, and task notes follow AGENTS.md's note-hygiene rule.

   Use three triggers:
   - **Size budget exceeded:** count lines, because line count is the honest cheap proxy for session-load token cost.
     Prune any over-budget file.
     Budgets: `data/captain.md` 40 lines; `data/learnings.md` 60 lines; `data/projects.md` about 2 lines per registered project.
     For `data/projects.md`, preserve the registry's parseable project lines; compress descriptions rather than changing the registry shape.
   - **Staleness:** more than 7 days since the last hygiene pass.
     Track the last pass in `data/.last-memory-hygiene` as an ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD` is enough).
     If the timestamp file is absent, treat it as stale once so the home gets a baseline pass.
   - **Explicit request:** `/stow prune`, "prune memory", or an equivalent captain request forces the full pass.

   When no trigger fires, do not read or rewrite the full memory set again.
   Print one short status line such as `memory within budget, last pruned 2026-07-04` and skip the phase.
   When a trigger fires, run the checklist below across the scoped files, then write today's ISO date to `data/.last-memory-hygiene` even if the pass found nothing to edit.

   Prune checklist:
   - Delete entries that are superseded, disproven, or expired; dated entries should make this judgment visible.
   - Consolidate clusters: several entries about one topic should become one rewritten durable entry.
   - Re-route misfiled knowledge to its most specific home per AGENTS.md's knowledge-routing table.
     If a fact is project-intrinsic, do not hand-edit that project's `AGENTS.md`; flag or file normal crewmate work so it lands through the project delivery pipeline.
   - Tighten prose without losing load-bearing facts, active constraints, or the "why" behind captain feedback.
     When in doubt, consolidate rather than delete.
   - Never prune away standing captain orders, safety tripwires, active access constraints, never-reenable rules, or anything the captain marked important.
     These may be compressed, but the operative instruction must survive.

5. **Curate, don't just append.**
   When a finding overlaps or supersedes something already on disk, prefer rewriting or pruning the existing entry over piling on a new one.
   Graduation moves are limited to exactly three: promote a learning to the shared `AGENTS.md` via PR, fold it into `data/captain.md`, or delete a stale entry.
   Do not invent other graduation paths.

6. **Report to the captain.**
   Summarize, in plain outcome language (section 9): what was stowed and where, what was filed to the backlog, and whether the session is now safe to reset or destroy - i.e. whether every durable finding from this sweep now lives on disk rather than only in this conversation.
   Include the one-line memory-hygiene result: skipped within budget, pruned specific files, or unable to prune with the reason.
   If something could not be captured yet (for example, project-intrinsic knowledge waiting on a crewmate to land it), say so explicitly rather than reporting the session fully safe.

## Scope exclusion: no skill storage

`/stow` must **never** store, create, or edit a skill as a destination for any finding.
There is no "graduate this to a skill" move in this skill's routing.
This is a deliberate, standing exclusion, not an oversight: even with the two-tier skill layout, a stow sweep is a memory-routing operation, not a way to author or mutate skills.
Writing learnings into either `.agents/skills/` or public `skills/` would still risk mixing fleet-local material with shared firstmate behavior or standalone installer-facing behavior.
Until a human deliberately scopes a skill change as firstmate repo work, route generalizable knowledge to the shared `AGENTS.md` (or other shared, tracked material) via the pipeline, and fleet-local knowledge to `data/`, never to a skill.
